I got my first job as a developer at 17yo as a frontend. Before that, I did some freelancing. In December 2021 I was hired again as a software engineer, working with JS, TS, and Rust. I also study outside in addition, C++ and OCaml.

If you have any questions and need help, you can call me wherever and however you prefer.
