Why? 'Cause don't care.

You don't need a prepare to learn something. Just do it with more practice and less overthinking. Learning is not linear, and you don't get expected results when starting something.

This line of thought about the learning curve creates a snowball that can make you give up. Example: want to code smart contracts in Rust? Ok, try to start coding. If you slice, probably will think "to code a smart contract in Rust, first I need to learn and know a lot about Rust." And NO, this is wrong. This line of thought creates a snowball and makes you give up. Want to learn about smart contracts in Rust? Ok, code your smart contract, and you will know what you need of Rust to code your project.

In the real world, not make sense to wait for linear things.

The only thing that happens when you think about the learning curve, is less time.
