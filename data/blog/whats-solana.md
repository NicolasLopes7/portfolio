### Programs

On Solana, we write "Solana programs"

Solana program is a smart contract.

A Solana program is a piece of code that lives on the blockchain Solana. A blockchain is a place where anyone can run code for a fee. The blockchain is run by "miners". In Solana, we call them "validators".

### Accounts

On Solana, all programs are "stateless". Users have an "account" and the Solana program can interact with these "accounts" users own. And yes, programs can control everything. One user can own 1000s of accounts. A way to think is an account is like a file, and users can have some different files. Developers can write programs that can talk to these files.

The program itself doesn't hold a user's data. The program just can talk to "accounts" that hold the user's data.
