Every market bubble bursts. The question is when and what you learn with this. In 1990, it was a time with a lot of confidence and few results. The Internet bubble was startups that thought it possible to go from Zero to One. But some few startups(dot com) was got it.

The proportion of confidence and results don't was matched. The consequences of this is was a lot of people losing money and losing jobs

With the belief that everyone was possible to go from Zero to One, people began to invest desperately in startups and some left their jobs betting only on the financial market. But there was a big problem, as the following image describes:

### How some startups don't lose and die with bubbles?

Globalization causes a bubble. But what is globalization?
In the context of the market, globalization is all that go from 1 -> N. This means that startups don't create something. Each FAANG goes from 0 -> 1. This is innovation. No one has the same idea as your startup has. This is innovation and the best way is probably the new way, never what someone doe before you. If some startup that makes something that already exists, this is not innovation and isn't unique, is part of globalization.

So, how some startups don't lose and die with bubbles? Going 0 -> 1. And not 1 -> N.
