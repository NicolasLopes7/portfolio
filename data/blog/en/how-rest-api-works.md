## Design

API's like SOAP or XML-RPC, has a strict framework for developers works on. And a cool thing is that REST API can be developed using any programming language and too support a large variety of data formats. 

But, create a default form to develop in any scenaries is needed, and the only requirement is that when we will developt, follow the six REST design principles. 

1. Uniform interface: ...
2. Client-server decoupling: ...
3. Statelessness: ...
4. Cacheability: ...
5. Layered system architecture: ...
